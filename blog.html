											<a href="#">Top 5 Challenges Faced By Beginner Developers</a>
										</h4>
                  <p>
                    
                    I was privileged to attend the #DevCTrainingWithAndela job fair in Lagos last year. I remember the guy sent by Facebook ask us to mention some of the challenges we face as developers.
                    Below I'll discussed 5 of the most mentioned challenges and our campaign suggestion for the way forward.
                    <br>
                    <p>UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS</p>
                    In Nigeria, people view developers the way they view pregnant women. Most of the time when a woman is said to be pregnant, people will start counting days for her. After few months they'll start looking at her belly and expecting it to protrude. After nine months they'll be expecting delivery. Imagine a woman who is said to be pregnant but 3, 6, 9 months later nothing happened.
                    This scenario illustrate what many beginner developers are facing in Nigeria which explains why they hardly get support. Many people have this misconception that once you start spending a lot of hours on a laptop, you are into 'Yahoo' scam. So, they'll start counting days for you expecting to see you buy a car, house and use expensive gadgets in a short while. But you and I know that as a beginner developer, you can't afford those luxuries. So, when people see there is no improvement in your finances, they become disappointed and frustrated with you.
                    It's time we address this unrealistic expectations from family, friends and 'money-wishers'.
                    <br>
                    <P>LACK OF POWER</P>
                    Power problem is peculiar to all developers in this part of the world. Many a times you have to be calculative and do your work when there is light or at night. If your family is not supportive, that will be a big challenge. The best way to overcome this is to let your family know that you won't be much available for house chores when there is light. Alternatively, using a neighbor's place when there is light can be of help.
                    EXPENSIVE DATA COST
                    Enough data access is very important for beginner developers. You'll need to download a lot of resources, watch videos, read lessons and tutorials online, install softwares and so on. The best way to address this is to get help from family, friends and well-wishers unless you have enough savings.
                    <br>
                    <P>POOR INTERNET NETWORK</P>
                    In most part of Nigeria, poor internet network is common place. As developers you often find yourself downloading/installing large size softwares and video packages. There are usually three ways to overcome this namely:
                    i. downloading at night
                    ii. using alternative network if available
                    iii. going to an area where network is strong and doing all your download at a go.
                    You may also combine two of the options above . I once go to lodge in an hotel to spend a night to be able to install all the softwares I needed to work and downloaded lesson videos.
                    LACK OF FAMILY SUPPORT
                    Lack of support from family and friends is closely related to unrealistic expectations. As I mentioned earlier, once you start spending a lot of hours on system, your family members will develop this misconception that you are into 'Yahoo' scam - in most cases. There are two polar reactions you can expect and neither is good for a beginner developer.
                    Some family care about their reputation, so they will do everything possible to frustrate you from pursuing a career in tech. Then there is the other family who don't care as far as there is quick return. This set of family and friends will start counting days for you. The sooner you hit it, the better. If after a while the cash is not forthcoming, they'll become frustrated with you. And of course because they believe you are into 'Yahoo' scam they'll not support you in any way.
                    The best way to overcome this is to get your family and friends involved from the beginning. Explain to them the sacrifices you need to make and the support you expect from them. Share your goals and where you'll like to be in specific number of months or years. Believe me, if you don't do this, what will take you six months will take you two years. The funny part is that this same family members and friends will not wait a second to knock on your door to seek for help when you make it to the top.

                    We've thought much about this challenges and finaly came up with a campaign idea on the way forward at Webclick Academy.
                    In the coming days, we'll be launching the #1Family1Coder campaign to help create awareness to families to give beginner developers a breathing space, provide needed support and create the atmosphere for success.
                    In addition to the above, this campaign is design to help raise one professional programmer in participating families and at the same time promote family small businesses using the internet-of-things.

											<a href="#">Can A President Of  Igbo  Extraction Becomes President Of Nigeria</a>
										</h4>
                  <p>
                    Increased demands for Nigeria’s President of Igbo extraction and varying reactions to the call have elicited early interest in how Africa’s most populous country will likely chose its president in 2023. Though three years away, the demands and subsequent reactions have not only brought the politics of 2023 presidency to the fore, they have also raised the question of the chances of Ndigbo to produce the country’s president in 2023.
Chiedu Okoye, a poet, in his contribution to the chances of Ndigbo to produce Nigeria President in 2023, pointed out two critical issues of interest when he said: “In the Fourth Republic, the Igbos fluffed a golden opportunity to produce a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction when they betrayed the late Alex Ekwueme at the PDP Convention in Jos in 1998. At that time, he was in a pole-position to emerge as the PDP Presidential candidate in the run-up to the 1999 Presidential election.
“Had he won that PDP Presidential ticket, he would have become the President of Nigeria as PDP was the most formidable political party in Nigeria, but his Igbo compatriots, who were top members of PDP, sold him down the river for pecuniary and selfish reasons.
“Since the end of the civil war, the Igbo people have not reached a consensus on an issue, not to talk of their fighting to achieve a common objective with single-mindedness and uncommon resoluteness. Now, they work at cross-purposes regarding issues that are critical to the development of the Southeast; this has become a major drawback in their quest to produce a Nigerian President of Igbo origin,” he said.
As Okoye pointed out, it has become clear that the Igbo as a major ethnic group in Nigeria, with abundant high quality human resources, stands a very good chance of producing Nigeria’s president in a free and fair election. The challenge therefore seems to lie mainly on the attitude of Igbo political leaders and the kind of politics Ndigbo have chosen to play since independence. It is instructive that in spite of the foremost role Ndigbo, led by Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, played in the struggle for independence, when it was time to share political offices, they lost out because of reasons still being debated by political scholars.
Also, since after the bloody civil war, when Ndigbo lost their prime leadership position in government and public offices in Nigeria, some informed observers have blamed top Igbo leaders for alleged failure to reach out to other ethnic groups so as to regain their trust. They are also blamed for seeming clearly divided on things that concern their region and people, like the things that transpired in PDP Convention in Jos in 1998 where Ekwueme lost out mainly because his people allegedly dumped him at the last minute.
Whether these allegations are true or not remains to be seen. But two things many seem to agree on are that for an Igbo man or woman to emerge the president of Nigeria, Igbo elite must first unite and play the primary role of winning the trust and support of the leaders of other Nigerians.
How much support from the North?
Over the years, there has been the impression that the major opposition for the emergence of Nigerian President of Igbo extraction is from the north. This impression was heightened in 2019, when the leader of Arewa Youth Consultative Forum, Yerima Shettima, said President Muhammadu Buhari would be succeeded by another northerner in 2023, adding, “I know we need to work together as a country, but you also know that anything about democracy has to do with the number of people as the majority vote carries the resolution.”
As if to confirm that position, Mallam Maman Daura, a close relative of President Muhammadu Buhari, recently raised the debate on Igbo presidency in 2023, when he told the BBC, Hausa Service, that zoning should be discontinued in the search for the next president of Nigeria. He said any zone is free to produce the next president of Nigeria provided such a candidate has the qualification to govern the country.
“This turn by turn, it was done once, it was done twice, and it was done trice. It is better for this country to be one; it should be for the most competent and not for someone who comes from somewhere,” he said.
Perhaps, because he is an influential nephew of President Buhari, Daura’s comments attracted so many reactions from concerned Nigerians, including top Igbo groups. The Presidency had to disassociate itself from his views.
In its reaction, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, said it would be the turn of the South, particularly the Southeast, to produce the president in 2023.
The organisation cautioned that equity should not be sacrificed on the altar of “parochialism,” pointing out that it was the rotation sentiment that produced the incumbent.
Reacting, the Presidency, in a statement signed by Buhari’s spokesman, Garba Shehu, said Daura’s comments were personal views and did not reflect the views of Buhari’s administration.
“It is important that we state from the onset that as mentioned by the interviewee, the views expressed were personal to him and did not, in any way, reflect that of either the President or his administration,” Shehu said in a statement.
But if the views propagated by Shettima and Daura, support earlier perceptions of the position of the North on Igbo Presidency, recent utterances of some prominent northern elders however suggest that even the North is today not united in opposition against Igbo President of Nigeria and that Ndigbo may get appreciable support from the North in 2023 if the politicians and elders from the Southeast region, their neighbours from the South-south and Southwest play the right politics.
Recently, elder statesman, Alhaji Tanko Yakassai, added his voice in support of Igbo presidency in 2023, saying the Southeast zone remained the only part of the country yet to produce a President. Yakassai, who spoke in an interview on a television programme monitored in Lagos, however said power is not served to anybody but earned.
To realise the dream of producing Nigerian president in 2023, Yakassai therefore advised Igbo politicians and leaders to reach out to Nigerians in other zones.
“I have a lot of sympathies for the Igbos as far as producing a president for Nigeria is concerned. The Southwest, South-south and the North have all tasted it but the Southeast has not tasted the presidency,” he said, adding, “However, nobody gives political power to anybody. You have to fight for it. So, I expect the Southeast to reach out to other sections of the country for votes. By their fortune or misfortune, the Southeast is landlocked, not only in terms of the seas but also in its relationship with other people in the country. “We, in the north, don’t have any problem with the Igbo. The Igbo are in every village in the north doing business. The Yoruba are more skeptical of the Igbo, so they (Igbo) should reach out to them for 2023 presidency. The Igbo should go out, seek the understanding of fellow Nigerians to support their aspiration for the presidency but should not threaten or antagonize people. They should persuade them to vote for you,” Yakasai said.
The elder statesman also advised the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, and his followers to slow down on their agitation for the state of Biafra. “We are all better off in a united Nigeria. Though the Igbos have not produced a president, they dominate the economic life of the country,” he said.
He also told Igbo leaders to come together, pursue the project of producing Nigeria President in 2023 “through dialogue and reaching out.”
Will Southwest, South-south support Ndigbo?
Perhaps beyond the level of support Ndigbo would likely get from the North, there is the argument that the support of the two other geo-political zones, Southwest and South-south is more critical to Ndigbo if they intend to produce Nigeria’s President in 2023.
Dr. Francis Ukaegbu, a political scientist told The Nation that the political challenge Ndigbo have faced since independence is more with the other regions in the South than the North. “Our problem is more with our brothers and sisters in the Southwest and South-south. This has always been the case. Everybody knows that power has been rotating between the North and the South. Anybody agitating to return power to the North after Buhari’s second term does not wish Nigeria well. The South will produce the next President. That being the case, the Southeast, being the only Southern region yet to produce the president since 1999, should first get the support of the Southwest and the South-south. Once this is done and the South has a united position, the majority of the North will support an Igbo president.
“You can see that enemies of the Southeast are always, deliberately confusing the issues of presidency of Igbo extraction, restructuring and Biafran agitation. This ploy is devilish. Everybody knows that all Nigerians want genuine restructuring, just as we all know that Biafran agitation by IPOB and MASSOB is product of frustration of some Igbo youths arising from marginalisation, distrust and rejection since after the civil war. It is not right to equate the extreme reaction of youths with what the entire Igbo race needs. I think Igbo presidency will help allay the fears and suspicion of Igbo youths and truly reunite Nigeria.
“To achieve Igbo Presidency, leaders and people of Southwest and South-south would need to forgive Ndigbo in any way they may have offended them, support their aspiration and help unite the South. This unity is very crucial to achieve the much needed political balance in Nigeria.”
Some political leaders from the other regions in the South have also added their voice to Igbo presidency project, pointing out how to achieve it. One of them is Harris Emanuel Senator Anietie Okon, an elder statesman, and pioneer National Publicity Secretary of Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Okon, who served in the Senate between 1999 and 2003, argues that the time is ripe for Igbo presidency but decries the lack of unity among Ndigbo, especially their leaders. As he puts it: “The time is ripe for the Igbo to aspire to the presidency as conceded by none other than Chief E.K. Clark being the indisputable leader of the South-south but the Igbo are disgracing themselves. How are they at this time when they should be united inciting fifth columnists, and betrayal pops up and talks about factions and so on in the much respected and universally accepted Igbo representation called the Ohanaeze? It is in keeping with them and I hope they are not going to give us or the general accusation that when the Igbo confront a situation, one of them or any of them may come to the beckoning of saboteurs against Igbo interest by thinking selfishly.”
Also in his reaction, elder statesman and leader of the Yoruba apex socio-political organisation, Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, recently declared that Nigeria risks disintegrating if the Southeast is not allowed to produce the next President in 2023. Adebanjo has, since 2019, consistently made this call.

                    Peter Okoye who took to Instagram to dish out a motivational post, told parents that if they really love their children they should get a business not a job. According to the singer, 
                    when one dies, his kids inherits a business not a job. However if one dies on a job, the employee finds a replacement almost immediately.

											<a href="#">Oyo Serial Killer: I killed another person after escaping from police custody</a>
										</h4>
                  <p>
                    Sunday Shodipe, a 19-year-old murder has confessed to killing another person after escaping from police custody two weeks ago.
Mr Shodipe made the confession when he was paraded by the state police commissioner, Joe Enwonwu, on Wednesday.
PREMIUM TIMES reported that the suspect was arrested on July 17 for killings at Akinyele area of Ibadan during COVID-19 lockdown. He reportedly killed at least three women within two months.
He later escaped from police custody on August 11 but was rearrested on August 23.
Mr Shodipe, on Sunday, said he was able to escape due to police negligence.
Speaking with journalists, on Wednesday, while being paraded alongside 32 other suspects, he confessed to killing one, Oladeji Funmilayo.
He explained that a herbalist with whom he was earlier detained advised him to run away to enable him get blood to appease some spirits.
“After escaping from Mokola, I needed to appease the god and that was why I went to Akinyele to kill the woman. Blood gushed out and I recited what Baba always said I should recite, mentioning his name. I disappeared as usual.”

										</h4>
                  <p>
                    Making money per day with Google AdSense
                    can be done from a home office .Many website owners are doing it.
                    The only thing you need is planning,
                    work, determination, and passion about your topic or niche.
                    Term Definitions
                    
                    Before diving into the exact process, here's some terminology
                    for better understanding of Google AdSense.
                    
                    AdSense: AdSense is when you place Google Ads on your website,
                    and when a visitor from your website clicks on an ads, Google pays you
                    68% of what the advertiser pays them. It's free to sign up.
                    
                    CTR: Your ad Click-Through Rate is the number of ad clicks divided by
                    the number of individual ad impressions. Suppose you are showing 3 AdSense
                    ads on every page of your website, 1 page view is equal to 3 ad impressions.
                    
                    CTR = Clicks / Ad Impressions X 100
                    
                    Suppose, you get 5 clicks out of 500 ad impressions, your CTR would be 1% (5/500X100).
                    
                    CPC: Cost Per Click is the revenue you earn each time a visitor clicks on your ad.
                    CPC is determined by the advertisers. In some competitive niches like finance,
                    marketing, online products etc. advertisers may be willing to pay more per click than others.
                    
                    CPM: CPM means “Cost Per 1000 Impressions.”
                    
                    
                    When your CTR is 1% and your average CPC is $0.25. it’s quite achievable to make $100 dollars a day
                    and lots of people are doing it. Let's assume that a Page View = An Ad Impression.
                    
                    
                    You need to write quality articles on your site, These articles can be as little as 300 words.
